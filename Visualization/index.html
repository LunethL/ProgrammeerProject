      <h2>Fanfiction</h2>
      Fanfiction is a name for stories written by fans of an original work which use its setting and/or characters <br><br>
      The series has ended, or the next season might be far off, or maybe someone just had a great idea and wanted to write it down. No need to create a whole bunch of characters <br>
      and no need to introduce them, because the majority of the people who read your story will have watched or read the original work too. If it's shit (and it's shit quite often), <br>
      that's fine too. It won't get read and maybe a few people will insult you and your story, but you've still made your mark on your favourite work.
      <br><br>
      With the introduction of the internet, it's become far easier to share these fanfictions. The two biggest sites are Fanfiction.net (FF.net for short), a commercial site that <br>
      has some strict rules about the content of the fanfiction, and Archive Of Our Own (AO3), a fan-made and fan-run site that has very lax rules. Fanfiction.net has banned <br>
      fanfiction about real people and fanfiction with explicit violence or sex, among other things, while Archive Of Our Own welcomes everything that's legal and has even a <br>
      hint of fanfiction in it. This visualization shows an overview of the fanfiction from both sites so you can see for yourself what it's all about.
